# Programming Editors
This one works in Mac, Windows, Linux 

http://www.sublimetext.com/3
It has color-coding of programming files which is essential.
Your editor is the most important tool you will ever use as a
programmer. It is a personal decision - kind of like clothing.

# Loop - traditional while

  numbers = [1,2,3]
  count = 0
  index = 0
  while index < numbers.size
    count = numbers[index] + count
    index = index + 1
  end
  puts count

---
# Loop - each
  2 basic kinds of loops

  count = 0 
  [1,2,3].each do |element|
    count = count + element
  end

# Data Type Object - 0
Concept

Objects have data (properties)
Objects have method (messages that have response)
Objects need to be created ( Ruby creates some objects automatically)

Objects are a Design tool.
---
# Data Type Object - 1 - to_s
\\
1 # already an object (Fixnum)
Object.new.to_s # new Generic Object(kinda useless)
\\
---
# Data Type Object - 2
\\
class Thing1
  def initialize
    @name = 'Thing1'
  end
end
\\
---
# Data Type Object - 3
\\
class Thing2
  def initialize
    @name = 'Thing2'
  end
end
\\
---
# Data Type Object - 4
\\
class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
  def name
    @name
  end
  def to_s
    "#{self.class} : #{@name}"
  end
end
