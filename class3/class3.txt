# Beginners Mind.

When I had a concussion : unordered thoughts => no programming.
After the first week I was able to program for 15 minutes.
I got this idea to build an inventory across all subaru of america
websites. I was able to write 20 minutes and then developed a headache,
I took a break and wrote another 20 minutes. I took a break and wrote 
another 20 minutes. Then for the next 2 days I had terrible migranes
and was sad.

# Beginners Mind

When we start as a beginner - we don't even know the basics - this is
the perfect state of mind that can always be striven for - in this state
of mind we can discover the basics.

# Beginners Mind

The basics are like water and bread and fruit and vegitables (and fish
or meat if you like) - the basics are.

# Beginners Mind

You do not have to know the basics - only you need the mind that can
discover the basics - you can take as long as you wish to develop this
mind - you can take as long as you wish to develop the basics.

# Beginners Mind

If desire the most advanced knowledge - you will always meet the basics
and may be frustrated by this - this is because you are who you are
right now - and that is ok - it couldn't be any other way.

# Beginners Mind

Accepting this is reality - is beginners mind - it is the mind that
learns from all things, all things become its' teacher, it has no
sense of time, place, or being - but exists only with time, place and
being.

# Begining Programming

The basics of programming are reading and writing.
Read is most important. Writing can be used to understand
what you read - but if you cannot read - you cannot write
anything worth reading. (sorry it's true)
