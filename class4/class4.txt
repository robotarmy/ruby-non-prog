Today you are going to write a full program

A tire size is 3 parts and written as the string

255/50R16 means that the tire is 

255 milimeters wide
50  series profile
R   radial tire
15  inch rim size

Tire diameter is calculated with the following 
formula:

((((Width * (profile/100)) / 25.4) * 2 ) + rim size )

standard tire format, it will only calculate if
the correct format is entered.
