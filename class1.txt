My name is Curtis Schofield — I will be your Teacher.

# Ruby for Non-Programmers

After taking this class you will be born a rubyist - you will be a baby, 
naked after being born into the world of programming.

With this class you will be a burgeoning programmer and your first
language will be ruby.
 

Be Introduced to  :
	Basic Input/Output
	How computers think
	How to structure data for computers (Array / Hash / Integer )
	How much computers like to repeat (loop 0)
	How much computers like to repeat (loop 1 )
	HTTP Protocol that is behind the interwebs

# Setting Expectations Part 1

Class will begin with a basic lecture and then will explore some topics.

Coding theory will be practiced in Lecture 1.

Students will be expected to dedicate at least 1 evening for class 
and 1 evening for independent study during the week on optional topics

I enourage you to enjoy this process and be wise to the fact that this
skill will take time, effort and patience to develop. 

These 4 classes are meaning to prepare you for your journey.
---

# Setting Expectations Part 2

At the beginning of class 2,3,4 I will expect to receive a report about any insights you
had during the week, during your independent study, or maybe in the middle of the night!

There will be ‘option’ topics which I will list each class that can spur your own personal exploration,
you do not have you build anything complex (unless you wish to try) but some theory or exposure
to these topics can be often give you some perspective about your own interests. 

You can use my suggestions for optional topics or invent your own!

# Setting Expectations Part 3

Please Be Advised:

This program will introduce you to programming and will require concentration,
patience, and occasionally sudden strokes of insight. 

You don’t have to have a sense of humor, tolerance, or compassion in the learning process — but it will help and is strongly recommended.

By exploring, learning, and practicing the basic incantations of programming lore
you’ll start your journey to become an ordinary every day ruby programmer!

# Class 1

Lecture:
 - testing
 - data type - number
 - data type - string - case study : html
 - control flow - if
 - input / output - puts / gets
 - data type - containers

Coding:
  base 10, base 16, base 2 , and base 8- ‘bracelet exercise’

  What is a base?

# Testing


---
# Data Type Number

\\
1 # i am a number
2 # me too
3.15 # i am a fancy number called a Float
\\
---

# Data Types "String" - 1

  "abc" =='abc'

---

# Data Types "String" - 2

  "a b c " == 'a b c' ? 

---

# Data Types "String" - 3

  Who decides what an 'a', 'b', 'c' is?

---

# Data Types "String" - 4

  Number   Letter
  97       a
  98       b
  ??       c

  ??       A
  42       B

# Data Types "String" - 5 - Ruby Concept 1

  Ruby Concept "Object"

  A basic unit of data in ruby is known as 'object instance' often this is shortened to 'object'

  example:

  "abc" is object of String

---

# Data Types "String" - 6 - Ruby Concept 2

  Object Concept "Message/Response"

  A basic unit of action in object languages is known as 'message'. As actions have consequence so it goes that
  messages have a response.

  The messages that are sent to an objects are known as 'methods'

---

# Data Types "String" - 7 - Ruby Concept Method 1

  methods of a String instance with no arguments

  - "".length
  - "1".to_i

---

# Data Types "String" - 7 - Ruby Concept Method 2

  methods of a String instance can take another object as input

  - "a".==('a')
    => true

  - "a".==('b')
    => false

  - "a".equal?("b")
    => false

  Completely different
  - "abc".split(//)
    => [ "a" , "b", "c" ]

#  Coding Break - Number Theory exercise - 1

  A code bracelet starts with 
   a decimal number 
   you convert this to a binary number (base 2),
   then convert to hexidecimal (base 16),  
   then convert to octal (base 8) 
   and back to decimal.

---


#  Coding Break - Number Theory exercise - 2

    Base 10 => Base 2 => Base 16 => Base 8 => Base 10 (check)

    Help:
    Binary Expansion: 
      where 'c' is either 0 or 1
      c1 would be position 1 (leftmost)
      c8 would be position 8 (rightmost)

    (c1 * 2^0) + (c2 * 2^1) + (c3 * 2^2) + (c4 * 2^3) + 
    (c5 * 2^4) + (c6 * 2^5) + (c7 * 2^6) + (c8 * 2^7)

    30 minutes : Convert a few of these numbers

    1, 11, 21, 33, 64, 89, 128, 141, 240, 255, 1026 (bonus) ,2014 (bonus bonus), 65537 (mega bonus)

# Control Flow - if

  Boolean (2) Logic

    true, false

  Boolean operators

    and, or, not, xor
---

# Control Flow - if
\\
  if 'abc' == 'abc '
     # equality
  else
     # no equality
  end
\\
---
# Input / Output Devices

  what are some input devices on a computer?

  what are some output devices on a computer?
 
---

# Input / Output - Ruby

  keyboard => input device 
    in ruby this is the 'gets' command

  screen/console => output device 
    in ruby this is the 'puts' command

---

# Input / Output - Ruby
\\
  # chomp : remove 'enter'/'return' key from input

  inputValue = gets.chomp 

  if inputValue == "1"
    puts "ice cream"
  else
    puts "My input heard this"
    puts inputValue
  end
\\

---

# Data Types - containers.

  Map, Dictonary, Hash, Associative Array are names for a kind of container.


  Array, Vector, List, Set are are names for another kind of container.

  Ruby's common containers are 'Array, Hash, and Set'

---
# Data Types - containers 1 - array
\\
  []  # is used to denote an empty array in ruby.

  ["a" # would be an element with a single array

  ["a", "b"] # would be two elements in a single array

  ["a", 19 , 3.14] # would be 3 elements of differnt kinds in a single array

  ["a", [19, [3.14, "pi"], "nineteen"], "first letter of alphabet"] # array with arrays with arrays!
\\
  In an Array the 'index' is a numerical position of a value.

---
# Data Types - Case Study - HTML
\\
  <html>
    <body>
      <p> I am a paragraph </p>
    </body>
  </html>
\\

HTML is a giant string, that has special substrings inside to make structure.

It also can be considered as an array!

# Data Types - Case Study - HTML

Just one way to represent a html string in an array

\\
  ["html",["body",["p",["I am a paragraph"]]] # one way

  ["html",["body",["p",["I am a paragraph"] "/p"], "/body"], "/html"] # another way
\\



---
# End Of Class - Study Topic Suggestions

  Pick one option, or invent your own - 
  prepare a small paragraph in your own words about the topic.

  This is your opportunity to share random facts!

- @option concept: bits, bytes, nibble
- @option concept: strings, parsers, lexers, yacc, regexp
  @option history: computer culture, ARPANET, FIDONET
- @option history: windows, unix, lisp machine
